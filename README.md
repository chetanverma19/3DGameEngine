# 3DGameEngine
3D Game Engine from Scratch

Executable: /exe/demo3DEngine.exe 

Main Code File: /src/demo3DEngine.cpp

Ideal Screen Width: 640
Ideal Screen Height: 360

Global spin not recommended for Terrain model.

Known bugs being ironed out:

1. Crashing and not loading a second time. (Re-download and/or re-extract and run again should work for now, sorry!)
2. Width and height get swapped sometimes, debugging right now, might possibly move to OpenGL console rendering to try and solve.
